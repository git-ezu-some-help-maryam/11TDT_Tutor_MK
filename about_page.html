        <h2>What 2TURING Is All About</h2>
        <p>
            2TURING isn't just a tutoring service; it's a space built by students, for students. 
            Everything we do is shaped by passion, purpose, and real understanding. 
            We know what it feels like to be stuck or stressed, and we're here to make sure no one has to learn alone. 
            We believe learning should feel empowering, not overwhelming. Our tutors don't just help with homework; they help you build confidence in yourself.
            Every learner is different, and that's what we love. We take time to understand how you learn best and support you in a way that works.
            Whether you're preparing for NCEA, learning a new subject, or just trying to stay on top of classwork, we'll meet you where you're at and move forward together. 
            At 2TURING, we're always growing and listening. We care about what students need and make sure our tutors are supported too.
